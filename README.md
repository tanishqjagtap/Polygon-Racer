# Polygon Racer 🏎️

A low-poly arcade racing prototype built in Unity.

## 🎯 Goal
Learn core game-dev concepts:
- Physics-based movement
- Input handling
- Gameplay systems
- Rapid prototyping

## 🛠️ Features
✔ Player-controlled car  
✔ Rigidbody physics  
✔ Forward acceleration  
✔ Smooth steering  
✔ Basic prototype scene  

## 🎮 Controls
W — Accelerate  
A — Turn Left  
D — Turn Right  

## 🚧 In Progress
- Camera follow system
- Track layout
- Car tuning system (speed / grip / handling)

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Unity Rigidbody physics
- Adding forces for movement
- Scene setup & components
- Version control with GitHub

## 🛑 Notes
This is a **learning project** — not a commercial game.

## 📌 Tech
Unity (3D Core Template)
